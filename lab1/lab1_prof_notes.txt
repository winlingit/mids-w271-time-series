General comments about Lab



EDA

- EDA should be well organized and it should not be a chart-dump. Proceed from univariate, bivariate, multi-variate. Remember, the EDA is like answering a series of questions about variable characteristics, potential transformations, relationships etc. 



Difference in modeling strategy

- Students chose one of two approaches, but I could not tell if you fully understood the differences between the two.



- Model 1 estimates the prob that an O-ring will fail



- Model 2 estimates the prob that a flight will have at least 1 O-ring failure



Implications for independence

- The lack of detail on that front led to relatively imprecise assessments about the consequences of the independence assumption not being met.



For model 1, it is a big problem because it renders the entire model invalid



For model 2, we could suffer from some omitted variable bias (if there are shuttle specific characteristics that matter) or biased standard errors.



Bootstrapping

If you attempted it, you got credit. I will post some notes on this later.



Take some time to think about your Labs. Email me if you still are having trouble figuring some stuff out.



Finally, some groups put in a lot of effort and I appreciate it!
