## Question 1: EDA
During your EDA, you notice that your data exhibits both seasonality (different months have different heights) AND that there is a clear linear trend.  How many order of non-seasonal and seasonal differencing would it take to make this time-series stationary in the mean?  Why?

Behavior of ACF and PACF for ARMA models (from SS2016, p.71):
  - AR(p):  ACF tails off, PACF cuts off after lag p
  - MA(q):  ACF cuts off after lag q, PACF tails off
  - ARMA(p,q):  both ACF and PACF tail off

The variance of the series appears to decrease over time, so we take the log of the series to stabilize the variance.  The ACF decays slowly, so we take the difference with lag 1 (1 month) to remove the trend.  The resulting ACF shows seasonal autocorrelation every 12 months that decays gradually.  Now, we take the difference with lag 12 (1 year) to remove the seasonal trend.  The ACF now cuts off after lag 12, and the PACF decays slowly. This implies a seasonal MA(1) model of the seasonal differenced, differenced-log series and SARIMA(0,1,0)(0,1,1) final model overall.  So to remove trend and seasonality, we would perform non-seasonal differencing of order 1 and seasonal differencing of order 1, with a 12-month seasonal period.  


```{r, warning=FALSE}

# EDA
unemp = read.csv("UNRATENSA.csv")
# head(unemp); tail(unemp)
x = ts(unemp$UNRATENSA, start = c(1948, 1), frequency=12)
plot.ts(x, main = 'Unemployment rate by month, January 1948 - June 2017', ylab = 'Unemployment rate (%)')

lx = log(x)  # log transform to stabilize variance
acf2(lx, 130)  # ACF gradual decay

dlx = diff(lx)  # diff by 1 lag to remove trend
acf2(dlx, 130)

ddlx = diff(dlx, lag=12)  # diff by 12 lags to remove season trend
acf2(ddlx, 250)

plot.ts(cbind(x,lx,dlx,ddlx), main='Unemployment rate by month, January 1948 - June 2017')
```



## Question 2: SARIMA
It is Dec. 31, 2016, and you work for a non-partisan think tank focusing on the state of the U.S. economy.  You are interested in forecasting the unemployment rate through 2017 (and then 2020) to use it as a benchmark against the incoming administration's economic performance.  Use the dataset UNRATENSA.csv and answer the following:

a. Build a SARIMA model using the unemployment data and produce a 1-year forecast and then a 4-year forecast.  Because it is Dec. 31, 2016, leave out 2016 as your test data.

  - How well does your model predict the unemployment rate up until June 2017?
  
  The plot of the actual and predicted unemployment rate shows that the model is highly accurate.  [what is formal reasoning?]
  
  - What does the unemployment rate look like at the end of 2020?  How credible is this estimate?
  
  The model predicts an unemployment rate of 2.83% at the end of 2020.  This is not a credible estimate, however, since the confidence interval for this prediction contains 0.

```{r}
# fit model on training set and run diagnostics
train = window(x, end=c(2015,12), frequency=12)
test = window(x, start=c(2016,1), frequency=12)
fit1 = sarima(train, 0,1,0, 0,1,1,12)
fit1[c('AIC','AICc','BIC')]
# acf2(resid(fit1))

# 2-year forecast for 2016-2017
for2y = sarima.for(train,24, 0,1,0, 0,1,1,12)
comp2y = ts.intersect(test, for24$pred)
ts.plot(comp2y, lty=c(1,2), main='Unemployment rate by month, 2016-2017: Actuals and Forecast', ylab='Unemployment rate (%)')

# 4-year forecast
for5y = sarima.for(train,60, 0,1,0, 0,1,1,12)
for5y
```

b. Build a linear time regression and incorporate seasonal effects.  Be sure to evaluate the residuals and assess this model on the bases of the assumptions of the classical linear model, and the produce a 1-year and 4-year forecast.

  - How well does your model predict the unemployment rate up until June 2017?
  
  - What does the unemployment rate look like at the end of 2020?  How credible is this estimate?
  
  - Compare this forecast to the one produced by the SARIMA model.  What do you notice?

## Question 3: VAR.
You also have data on automotive car sales.

  - Use a VAR model to produce a 1-year forecast on both the unemployment rate and automotive sales for 2017 in the U.S.

  - Compare the 1-year forecast for unemployment produced by the VAR and SARIMA models, examining both the accuracy AND variance of the forecast.  Do you think the addition of the automotive sales data helps?  Why or why not?
